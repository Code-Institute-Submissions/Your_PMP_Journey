The Journey to accopplishing  the PMP (pROJECT Management Professional) accreditation is not easy.  It reuiquires hours of study and thats after you complete the 35 hour course.  This website  is a guide to persons on the pmp trial.  It provides study resources and of course the first step, the 35 hour course.

PMP certification can also be extremely valuable if you plan to advance in the current company you are working at. It puts you way ahead of your colleagues in terms of moving up the career ladder. Also, a certified manager can do much better in a gruelling project management interview than a non-certified one

The fail rate for the PMP exam is actually quite high at an estimated 40-50% for first-time test-takers. There is no specific number of questions that must be answered correctly in order to pass the PMP exam.  This is high and can be a costly journey.  

Anyone who aspires to attain PMP certification should be prepared for the exam. Consequently, first-time test takers should also be advised that the PMP certification exam is extremely difficult. The exam consists of 200 multiple-choice questions in a period of only four hours.

PMP certification can also be extremely valuable if you plan to advance in the current company you are working at. It puts you way ahead of your colleagues in terms of moving up the career ladder. Also, a certified manager can do much better in a gruelling project management interview than a non-certified one

-   ## Design Choices
  
      -   ### Colour Scheme
        - There is alot of whitespace in the application, the whitespace draws attention and attracts the user to 
           the eyecatching buttons and good quality images
    
      -   ### Imagery 
         - I selected images that are relevant to the content of the application.   The icon in the navbar has an orange seat, 
            and the buttons on the home page are orange.  This small detail improves the asthetics of the application
        
      
      
      -   ### Icons 
        -  The icon in the navbar is a good fit for the theme of the application
        -  Icons break up the information visually, creating space for the user and not overwhelming them with too much info at once.
        -  Each icon was chosen for it's clarity in quickly explaining the relevant meaning with an image.


-   ## Wireframes
    
    Wireframes were built in the early stages of development to get a rough outline of the structure needed for the planned features of the site. The wireframes were created     using Balsamiq. These can be viewed below:

# Deployment

## Local Deployment

To run this project, the following tools need to be installed:
 - An IDE (I used GitPod online IDE for creating this project)
 - MongoDB Atlas (for creation your database)
 - Git
 - PIP
 - Python

### Directions

 - 1.You can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting the following command into the terminal:
    git clone https://github.com/bridcourtney/VDU-Assessment.  Alternatively, you can save a copy of this repository by clicking the green button "Clone or download" , then      "Download Zip" button, and after extract the Zip file to your folder.
    
 - 2.In the terminal window change directory (CD) to the correct file location (directory that you have just created).
 
 - 3.Set up environment variables: ◦Create .env file in the root directory.  On the top of the file add import os to set the environment variables in the operating system.
    Set the connection to your MongoDB database(MONGO_URI) and a SECRET_KEY with the following syntax: os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YourSecretKey" os.environ["MONGO_URI"] =       "YourMongoURI"
    
 - 4.Install all requirements from the requirements.txt file putting this command into your terminal: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    Note: GitPod does not require sudo, so if you use another IDE, you will need to include sudo in the beginning of the command: sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt.
    
 - 5.Create a new Database called "vdu_check" in MongoDB Atlas.  You can sign up for free account, if you do not have one.
 
 - 6.In "vdu_check" database create the 4 collections below.  Once the collections are created you can run the application using the following command python3 run.py.

## Branching
  I used branching in this project.  I found it very useful at stages when I was embarking on new functionaility and not sure how it was going to turn out, it was reassuring   to know I had a choice whether to merge with the master or not.
  I soon realised each time I created a branch from Github, the following installs were required - 
   - pip3 install Flask
   - pip3 install Flask-PyMongo
   - pip3 install dnspython
   - pip3 install flask_wtf
   
  Also, very important reinstate the env.py. Check requirements.txt is up to date, otherwise you will have problems loading in Heroku

## Code & Credits
 - I referred to Flask and MongoDB documentation sources.
 - For building the Register, Login, Change Username/Password pages.  I followed the 'Python Mini Project Material'.
 - Flask WTForms Tutorials - Pretty Printed & https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/wtforms/.  Also https://github.com/irinatu17/MyCookBook
 - For UI & UX design concept I took inspiration from Pinterest & unsplash
 - The idea of using prefix-icons, asterixes and question-mark tooltips in forms was taken from https://github.com/irinatu17/MyCookBook
